## 🔢 Information Summary
- Credit history and Debt-to-income ratio emerged as the principal factor in securing a loan, hence applicants should maintain a good debt-to-income ratio and also build good credit history.
- Unfortunately, it turned out that high-income earners have an edge over the lower-income group. So you may consider taking a high-income job though it’s not a major requirement.
- In choosing the property, make sure your median income is higher than the median neighborhood income of where the property is located.
- Choose to buy a multifamily dwelling. Don’t apply for a loan to buy manufactured housing since that has a very low rate of mortgage approval.
- Apply for FSA/RHS loans. It has a relatively high chance of loan approval over the rest types.
- Consider getting a Home loan in King County.
- Apply for a loan to purchase a house; a Home Purchase loan has a significant approval rate.
- If you want a 100% rate of approval for your loan, then, apply for HOEPA loans.
- Secure your loan through the first lien.
- Black or African Amerian has a good chance of applying with a white American, Asian or Native Hawaiian.
